<QueryDeepEnough>
<Deepener> 'this will automatically select a random deepener and run it, and work with the QueryDeepEnough tag.
			//QueryDeepEnough opens a yes/no Dialouge and then jumps backwards to the first Deepener tag it finds (going backwards), then runs a deeper script (randomly).
Only use if you want your user repeating part of the script if they haven't gone under yet. QueryMulti or QueryYesNo allows
more control over script flow.

<ScriptName:ThisScriptName> 
(Note ScriptName will be used to identify a script by name internally when checking RequireScript tags.)
<IncludesFeature:FeatureName> //Will need a lot of feature names
<FeatureNotes:FeatureName,Details> These should be used to add readable notes to the fature such as "<FeatureName:Transformation>", "<FeatureNotes:CatGirl Transformation(Permanent)>"
It is to be noted FeatureNotes cannot be parsed as features that is why FeatureName will be required.

A compiled list of featurenames will be available which you will be required to checkbox and confirm.
Submitted scripts will be reviewed by hand before being added to script downloads lists. (Which will also be made in the future)
Script Packs will be made downloadable after the first public release (testing release)

A note to would-be scripters: Later on, a webservice which uses a trusted CheckSum system will allow you to upload your scripts,
get a checksum generated, and then on the next minor update your scripts will be added if they meet requirements.
Also, a tool to quickly select features your script includes and generate a header will be created soon!
users can still side-load un-trusted scripts as well, but unless your script shows up on the checksum list, users who
select to only run trusted scripts will automatically ignore your scripts even if they have installed them.

Additionally it will be possible to run this tag during a script: <RunScript:ScriptName> however--
When doing so, the system will recursively have to check through the script for all other scripts it requests to run.
It will then check those scripts against users preferences or safeties. So make sure that you avoid recursion if you can,
unless it is absolutely neccesarry.
